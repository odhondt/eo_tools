# EO-Tools

EO-Tools is a python toolbox that is currently able to search, download and process Sentinel-1 InSAR pairs, download and mosaic Sentinel-2 tiles and download various publicly available DEM (Digital Elevation Models). The S1 processor can compute phase, amplitude and coherence in the SAR geometry and reproject them in a geographic coordinate system.
